MONGO_URI="mongo-link-to-connect"
DB_LINK="mongo-link-to-connect"
# Prefer setting MONGO_URI to the exact MongoDB connection string. DB_LINK
# remains supported as a fallback and can be a full MongoDB URI
# (mongodb+srv://user:pass@host/db) or the host fragment that will be appended
# to mongodb+srv://. Credentials containing special characters should be
# percent-encoded.
